# rswt-flasher

The [RobertSonics WavTrigger](http://robertsonics.com/wav-trigger/) is an audio
player for wave files. Audio playback can be controlled through a serial port. 

`rswt-flasher` is a commandline utility for uploading an new firmware to a WavTrigger 

`rswt-flasher` works on Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+

The utility should run on any Operating System, but I only tested it on Linux
and Windows7. If anybody out there uses it on MacOS, please let me know...
